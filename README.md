# ReactJS Facebook messenger

The goal of this exercise is to learn how to think in React. 

##To get started

####Step 1

If you haven't already set up your project, head here and follow the instructions https://github.com/leanjscom/fb-messenger/blob/master/README.md


####Step 2
```sh
 git checkout react-router
 ``` 

###Exercise



1. Finish the implementation of the Login Component (located in src/components/Login.js). Requirements:
    1. The state of the inputs should be managed by the Login component (is that a controlled or uncontrolled component?). Hint: use the onChange event in the inputs
    2. Handle the onClick button to validate the inputs. For validation you can use password: 1234 and email: reactfanboy@facebook.com
    3. If the validation is correct redirect the user to the home page. Hint: you need the router. To inject the router use withRouter from 'react-router-dom'.
